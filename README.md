# Moin Bella!

## About

Moin Bella! makes it easier for dog owners, especially in cities, to get in touch with other dog owners.
You can easily search for people in your neighborhood and get some information about them and their dog. If you want to, you can contact them via mail. With the help of "Moin Bella!" you can also easily find dog places close to you.

This app was developed as my capstone project during the last four weeks of the Web Development Bootcamp of neue fische in May 2020.

This app was developed and optimized for mobile usage (iPhone 6/7/8), so please switch your browser to responsive mode.

You can take a look at the app [here](https://moinbella-f6a5b.web.app/)<br>
